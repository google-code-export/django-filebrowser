=The !FileObject=
New in Version 3.0: When browsing a directory on the server, you get a !FileObject (see base.py) for every file within that directory.

Any !FileObject has the following attributes:
  * *filename*
  * *filetype* (as defined in EXTENSIONS)
  * *filesize* (output with filesizeformat)
  * *extension* (as defined in EXTENSIONS)
  * *date* (getmtime)
  * *datetime* (datetime object)

  * *path* (relative to MEDIA_ROOT)
  * *path_relative* (=path)
  * *path_full* (including MEDIA_ROOT)
  * *url_relative* (=path)
  * *url_full* (including MEDIA__URL)
  * *url_save* (URL used for the !FileBrowseField)
  * *url_thumbnail* (Full URL for the Admin-Thumbnail)

An Image has additional attributes:
  * *dimensions* (tuple)
  * *orientation* (either "landscape" or "portrait")
  * *width* (in px)
  * *height* (in px)

A Folder has additional attributes:
  * *is_empty* (True/False)
