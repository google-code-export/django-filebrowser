*Why is it not possible to add the !FileBrowser to INSTALLED_APPS?*

Well, it IS possible. It (currently) just doesn´t make sense from my point of view. There´s no model and listing the !FileBrowser somewhere between other INSTALLED_APPS on the Index-Site of the Admin-Interface, is not very useful.
----
*Why do I have to copy the /media and /template directory?*

Django doesn´t serve media-files. This is done by Apache (or another webserver like lighttpd). Therefore, your media-files should be placed outside your Django project. You can copy the media-files to wherever you want - you just have to change PATH_FILEBROWSER_MEDIA in fb_settings.
----
*Where should I put the /media resp. /template directory?*

For the media-directory of the !FileBrowser you can either use Djangos Admin-Media directory (/django/contrib/admin/media) or your own media-directory. You just have to change PATH_FILEBROWSER_MEDIA in fb_settings to point to the right location.
