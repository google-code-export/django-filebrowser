= Image Generator =

With the *Image Generator*, you are able to define different versions/sizes for Images. This enables you to save an Original Image on your Server while having different versions of that Image to automatically fit your websites Grid.


== How to use it ==

  # *The Grid*
    First you need to know which versions/sizes of an Image you´d like to use on your Website. Let´s say you´re having the following Grid for your Website: *12 Columns with 60px for each column and 20px margin. (which is a total of 940px).*
  # *Image Versions/Sizes*
    With this Grid, you could (for example) save these Image Versions: a Thumbnail with a width of 140px (2 Columns), a Small Version with a width of 300px (4 Columns) for Overview-Pages, a Medium (width 460px, 6 Columns) and a Big Version (width 620px, 8 Columns) for your Content Area. Additionally, you may want to define 2 cropped versions: a 1-column-version with a width of 60px and a 2-column-version with a width of 140px.
  # *Defining Image Versions*
    Use fb_settings.py to define the name of your image-versions directory as well as the versions/sizes of your Images.
{{{
    IMAGE_GENERATOR_DIRECTORY = getattr(settings, 'FILEBROWSER_IMAGE_GENERATOR_DIRECTORY', '_versions')
    IMAGE_GENERATOR_LANDSCAPE = getattr(settings, "FILEBROWSER_IMAGE_GENERATOR_LANDSCAPE", [('thumbnail_',140),('small_',300),('medium_',460),('big_',620)])
    IMAGE_GENERATOR_PORTRAIT = getattr(settings, "FILEBROWSER_IMAGE_GENERATOR_PORTRAIT", 
    IMAGE_CROP_GENERATOR = getattr(settings, "FILEBROWSER_IMAGE_CROP_GENERATOR", [('cropped_',60,60),('croppedthumbnail_',140,140)])
}}}
  # Now you just Upload Images with the !FileBrowser (with "Using Image Generator") and every single Image will automatically fit anywhere on your Website. If you ever change the Grid of your Website or you want to change the size of your Images, just use a small python script to re-generate all Image Versions from the Original Image.
