=Basic Installation=

  # *Install the !FileBrowser*
    Install the !FileBrowser anywhere on your python-path. IÂ´m personally using the project-directory.
{{{
svn checkout http://django-filebrowser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/filebrowser/ filebrowser
}}}
  # *Copy Media*
    Copy the folder /media either to your admin media-directory (cp -R /path/to/filebrowser/media/filebrowser /path/to/your/admin/media/) or to your preferred media-directory (in this case, you have to edit URL_FILEBROWSER_MEDIA in fb_settings).
  # *Add filebrowser to your INSTALLED APPS.*
    Open your projects settings-file (settings.py) and add the filebrowser to your INSTALLED APPS. 
  # *Change fb_settings.py*
    Either change fb_settings.py or overwrite the filebrowser settings in your project settings-file (settings.py). See "Available Settings".
    Note: You do need an upload-directory. The default one is "uploads" inside your MEDIA_ROOT. Check URL_WWW and PATH_SERVER if you change this directory.
  # *Change your urls.py*
    Add the following line BEFORE the admin-urls:
{{{
(r'^admin/filebrowser/', include('filebrowser.urls')),
}}}
  # *Add the !FileBrowser to your Admin Indexpage*
    Edit /templates/admin/index.html. Add this code BEFORE {% for app in app_list %} ... {% endfor %}:
{{{
{% include "filebrowser/append.html" %}
}}}
  # That's it.

----
*IMPORTANT: About 90% of the problems installing the filebrowser are related to wrong URLS and/or PATHS. So, please read through [http://code.google.com/p/django-filebrowser/wiki/Settings Available Settings] and check everything with either _URL_ or _PATH_ carefully.*
