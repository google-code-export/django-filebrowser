=Basic Installation=

  # *Install the !FileBrowser*
    Install the !FileBrowser anywhere on your python-path. IÂ´m personally using the project-directory.
{{{
svn checkout http://django-filebrowser.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/filebrowser/ filebrowser
}}}
  # *Copy/Symlink Media*
    Copy the folder /media somewhere to your media-directory and change URL_FILEBROWSER_MEDIA (in fb_settings.py) accordingly.<br>
    Alternatively, you may want to use a symlink from your media-directory.
  # *Add filebrowser to your INSTALLED APPS.*
    Open your projects settings-file (settings.py) and add the filebrowser to your INSTALLED APPS. 
  # *Change filebrowser settings.py*
    Either change settings.py or overwrite the filebrowser settings in your project settings-file. See "Available Settings".
  # *Change your urls.py*
    Add the following line BEFORE the admin-urls:
{{{
(r'^admin/filebrowser/', include('filebrowser.urls')),
}}}
  # *Add the !FileBrowser to your Admin Navigation*
    With using Grappelli, you can add the !FileBrowser to your Admin Index Page by changing the Sidebar-Navigation (the !FileBrowser is already part of the Grappelli fixtures).
  # That's it.

----
*IMPORTANT: About 90% of the problems installing the filebrowser are related to wrong URLS and/or PATHS. So, please read through [http://code.google.com/p/django-filebrowser/wiki/Settings Available Settings] and check everything with either _URL_ or _PATH_ carefully (especially when using TinyMCE).*
