=Basic Image Editing with Snipshot=

Snipshot is a simple online-based Image-Editor. There´s no fancy stuff, but it works quite well for basic image-editing.

  # Set USE_SNIPSHOT to True in fb_settings.py 

Some Notes on using Snipshot:

  # It´s not possible to edit an image in the popup-window (when you open the !FileBrowser with the !FileBrowseField or a Rich-Text-Editor)
  # Because of Snipshots callback_agent, it´s not possible to set staff_member_required (this is a security issue, so if you´re using Snipshot with the !FileBrowser, you´re doing this on your own risk).
