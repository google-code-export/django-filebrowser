=Using the !FileBrowser with WYMEditor=

From my point of view, WYMEditor gets it right for about 97.3%. Not being able to insert/edit DIVs and SPANs is horrible though. The lack of a fullscreen-mode is another drawback. And since selected CLASSES are not highlighted, I don´t think customers will be satisfied ... so, waiting for !WysiHat instead ... 

If you just need to handle the most basic document structure, WYMEditor is a great solution. If your document is slightly more complicated, unfortunately there doesn´t seem to be a proper editing solution right now :-( 

Nevertheless, here´s an installation guide:

*Note: This is a big warning - using WYMEditor is NOT recommended by the contributors of the Django !FileBrowser.*
