=Using the !FileBrowser with WYMEditor=

From my point of view, WYMEditor gets it right for about 97.3%. Not being able to insert/edit DIVs and SPANs is horrible though. The lack of a fullscreen-mode is another drawback. And since selected CLASSES are not highlighted, I don´t think customers will be satisfied ...

If you just need to handle the most basic document structure, WYMEditor is a great solution.

Here´s an installation guide:

*This is a warning: using WYMEditor is currently NOT recommended by the contributors of the Django !FileBrowser. Use TinyMCE instead.*
