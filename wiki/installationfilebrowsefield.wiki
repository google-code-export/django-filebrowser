=Using the !FileBrowseField=

The !FileBrowseField is a Model field (see http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/fields/#field-types for other field types) used to select a File/Document/Image/Folder from your Media Server.

The !FileBrowseField makes selecting images/documents more comfortable compared with the given Image- or !FileField - especially if you don't want to limit the selection to a directory.

  # *Define your models like this*
{{{
from filebrowser.fields import FileBrowseField

class Publication(models.Model):
    ...
    image = FileBrowseField(max_length=200, initial_directory="/blog/", extensions_allowed=['.jpg', '.jpeg', '.gif','.png','.tif','.tiff'], format='Image', blank=True, null=True)
    pdf = FileBrowseField(max_length=200, initial_directory="/pdf/", extensions_allowed=['.pdf'], blank=True, null=True)
    ...
}}}

=== Attributes for the !FileBrowseField ===
  * *max_length*
    Since the !FileBrowseField is basically a !CharField, you have to define max_length.
  * *initial_directory*
    Server Directory shown when the User clicks on the !FileBrowser-Icon beneath the Input Field. This is a subdirectory of PATH_SERVER (see fb_settings.py). If you define PATH_SERVER as "/var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/media/uploads/" and initial_directory as "/blog/", you´ll see the server-directory "/var/www/vhosts/mysite.com/media/uploads/blog/". If you don´t define initial_directory (or define initial_directory as ""), you´ll browse PATH_SERVER. Note that you are NOT able to see a directory above PATH_SERVER.
  * *extensions_allowed*
    List of Extensions allowed for this Field. Users will get an error message ("Extension not allowed.") if the selected File has an extension not listed here. *If you want to allow every possible file-extension, set extensions_allowed="" or remove the attribute*. Extensions are automatically converted to lowercase - therefore, you don´t have to define '.JPG' and '.jpg', but only '.jpg'.
  * *format*
    Use this attribute to restrict selection to specific filetypes. E.g., if you use *format='Image'*, only Images can be selected from the !FileBrowser. Note: Image has to befined with SELECT_FORMATS.

=== Image Preview ===
The Thumbnail will automatically be generated using sorl-thumbnail. Clicking on the Thumbnail below the !FileBrowseField will open the Image in a new window/tab.
